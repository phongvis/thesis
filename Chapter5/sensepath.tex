\section{Chapter Overview}
\lettrine{C}{hapter} \ref{chap:schemaline} and \autoref{chap:timesets} discussed how to support users to explore temporal relationships of sensemaking through interactive timeline visualizations of their annotations. However, the relationship that emerges in the sensemaking process could be more complicated than a temporal one. Besides understanding how events are connected, getting to know why they happened in such an order is also important. This chapter investigates how to support users to explore such reasoning relationships of sensemaking though visualization of provenance data. Qualitative research methods are often used to gain understanding about this kind of relationship. Such a research process is highly manual and time-consuming: researchers collect observation data, transcribe screen capture videos and think-aloud recordings, identify recurring patterns, and eventually abstract the sensemaking process into a general model. This chapter contributes a visualization tool -- \emph{SensePath} -- that facilitates the exploration of reasoning relationships in sensemaking, focusing on qualitative research.

The previous two chapters visualize annotations made by users. Even though these annotations often contain high-level thinking by users, these information resources are limited. This is because making detailed and frequent notes requires a huge amount of time and effort from the users. Also, it may distract them from their sensemaking tasks. This chapter focuses on exploring \emph{reasoning relationship} of sensemaking through both \emph{user annotations} and automatically captured \emph{user actions}. SensePath provides multi-linked visualizations of the captured provenance and interactive features to support analysis. Two user-centered evaluations were conducted to explore how the tool would be used and identify any benefits it could provide. The participants were able to gain deep understanding of the sensemaking processes in relatively short time.
