\blfootnote{Previously published at the \emph{IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics}~\cite{Nguyen2016}.}\autoref{chap:schemaline} and \autoref{chap:timesets} enable users to explore complex temporal relationship of sensemaking through interactive timeline visualizations of their annotations. However, the relationship emerged in the sensemaking process could be more complicated than temporal one. Besides understanding how events are connected, why they happened in such order is also important. In this chapter, we investigate how to support users to explore the rational relationship of sensemaking though analytic provenance. Typically, qualitative research methods are used in understanding such relationship. This is a manual and time-consuming process: researchers collect observation data, transcribe screen capture videos and think-aloud recordings, identify recurring patterns, and eventually abstract the sensemaking process into a general model. We contribute a visual sensemaking tool -- \emph{\textcb{SensePath}} -- that offers an alternative and possibly faster approach in performing \emph{transcription} and \emph{coding}. 

The previous two chapters visualize annotations made by users. Even though these annotations may contain high-level thinking of the users, making detailed and frequent notes require a huge amount of time and effort from the users. Also, it may distract them from their sensemaking tasks. In this chapter, we focus on exploring \textch{rational relationship} of sensemaking through both \textcm{user annotations} and automatically captured \textcm{user actions}. SensePath provides multi-linked visualizations of the captured provenance and interactive features to support their further analysis. Two user-centered evaluation were conducted to explore how the tool would be used and identify any benefits it could provide. The participants found the tool intuitive and considerably reduced analysis time, allowing better understanding of the sensemaking process.
