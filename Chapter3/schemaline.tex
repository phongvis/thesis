\blfootnote{Previously published at the \emph{International Conference on Information Visualization}~\cite{Nguyen2014}.}As the first step toward supporting sensemaking using analytic provenance, this chapter discusses how to enable users to explore the hidden \textch{temporal relationship} of sensemaking through the \textcm{annotations} that the users made. \emph{Annotation} is a common approach to capture high-level thinking and reasoning of users throughout their sensemaking processes. \emph{Timeline} is a simple yet powerful technique to visualize time-oriented data, enabling users to examine information chronologically and to identify temporal patterns and relationships. However, existing timeline visualization methods are not specifically designed for the dynamic and iterative nature of sensemaking. In this chapter, we introduce a novel timeline visualization -- \emph{\textcb{SchemaLine}} -- to address these issues. Our user-centered evaluation shows that the participants found the new method easy to learn and use, and its features effective in supporting the sensemaking activities for which it was designed.
