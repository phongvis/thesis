\blfootnote{Published at the \emph{International Conference on Information Visualization}~\cite{Nguyen2014}.}As the first step toward supporting sensemaking using analytic provenance, this chapter discusses how to explore the \emph{temporal relationship} hidden in the sensemaking process, with a focus on the \emph{intelligence analysis} domain. Intelligence analysts often need to examine thousands of reports to identify potential threats from particular persons or organizations. Visual analytics systems provide automatic analysis techniques to leverage analysts from manual investigation of such high volume of documents. However, the limitation of working memory prevents analysts from holding and managing all discoveries simultaneously. \emph{Annotation} is a technique that can be used to capture high-level thinking and reasoning of analysts throughout their sensemaking processes. Moreover, analysts can organize their annotations to consolidate their thoughts such as in a timeline to represent a story.

\emph{Timeline} is a simple yet powerful technique to visualize time-oriented data, allowing examination of information chronologically and identification of temporal patterns and relationships. However, existing timeline visualization methods are not specifically designed for the dynamic and iterative nature of sensemaking. In this chapter, we introduce a novel timeline visualization -- \emph{SchemaLine} -- to address this issue. SchemaLine allows analysts to construct narratives from their annotations. It produces a compact but aesthetically pleasing layout and provides a set of fluid interactions allowing analysts to perform various sensemaking activities. Our user-centered evaluation shows that the participants found SchemaLine easy to learn and use, and its features effective in supporting the sensemaking activities for which it was designed.
