\section{Introduction}
Intelligence analysis is defined as ``the application of individual and collective cognitive methods to weigh data and test hypotheses within a secret socio-cultural context''~\cite{Johnston2005}. To gain a deeper understanding into the sensemaking process in intelligence analysis, Pirolli and Card~\cite{Pirolli2005} conducted a cognitive task analysis with analysts and proposed a process model of sensemaking, which was described earlier in detail in \autoref{sub:lr-sensemaking}. During the sensemaking process, analysts need to read thousands of reports and extract relevant details, organize them in a way that help the analysts to identify patterns and generate hypotheses. This is challenging because of the large number of documents involved and the complex relationships of entities discovered. Visual analytics systems~\cite{Pioch2006,Wright2006,Stasko2007} facilitate intelligence analysis with automated techniques applied to leverage manual investigation of a large document collection. For instance, named-entity recognition techniques~\cite{Nadeau2007} can identify entities (i.e., persons, organizations and locations), and topic modeling techniques~\cite{Blei2003} can extract the main themes discussed. To help analysts manage a large number of discoveries they made during the sensemaking process, the systems allow them to externalize their thoughts through note taking. Analysts are then often supported to freely organized their notes in a way that makes sense to them and facilitates their analyses, such as constructing a timeline of suspicious events.

% Problem of exisiting timelines in sensemaking
\emph{Timeline} is a simple yet powerful technique to visualize time-oriented data~\cite{Tufte1983}, allowing exploration and identification of temporal patterns and relationships in the data. It displays events along the time axis and position them at the time points at which they occur or the time ranges over which they last~\cite{Plaisant1996}. Timelines have been applied extensively in visualizing both raw data and analysis findings for supporting sensemaking. POLESTAR~\cite{Pioch2006} and HARVEST~\cite{Gotz2006} allow analysts to take notes, define new knowledge, and explore them through a timeline visualization. Jigsaw~\cite{Gorg2013} uses timelines to organize extracted named entities, one for each type. Similarly, nSpace2 Sandbox~\cite{SandboxTimeline2012} provides the creation of multiple sub-timelines for visualizing different types of artifacts. However, these timeline visualizations either lack an automatic layout~\cite{Pioch2006} or use an overly-simplistic linear layout~\cite{SandboxTimeline2012}. As a result, the visualization requires significant effort from analysts to manually arrange data elements, making it difficult to detect temporal patterns.

Sensemaking includes dynamic activities centering around the collected data and its explanation~\cite{Klein2003}. Therefore, to support the dynamic nature of sensemaking, timeline visualizations should allow analysts to create and edit temporal structures interactively. Also, the interaction should be intuitive and fluid~\cite{Elmqvist2011} to prevent analysts from extra cognitive effort and distraction. However, existing timeline visualization techniques are mainly designed for presenting a known story rather than revealing and constructing a hidden one interactively.

In this chapter, we introduce a novel timeline visualization -- SchemaLine -- to address the aforementioned challenges and support exploring temporal relationships in sensemaking. More specifically, SchemaLine contributes
\begin{itemize}
	\item A visual design and a compact, aesthetically pleasing layout for an interactive timeline that enables users to construct narratives or temporal schemas from user annotations.
	\item A set of fluid interactions with the timeline to support the sensemaking activities described in the Data--Frame model~\cite{Klein2003}.
\end{itemize}
