Timeline visualization is an important tool for sensemaking. It allows analysts to examine information in chronological order and to identify temporal patterns and relationships. However, many existing timeline visualization methods are not designed for the dynamic and iterative nature of the sensemaking process and the various analysis activities it involves. In this paper, we introduce a novel timeline visualization, SchemaLine, to address these deficiencies. SchemaLine is designed to group notes into analyst-determined schema, using a layout algorithm to produce compact but aesthetically pleasing timeline visualization, and includes fluid user interactions to support sensemaking activities. It enables interactive temporal schemata construction with seamless integration with visual data exploration and note taking. Our preliminary evaluation results show that the participants found the new method easy to learn and use, and its features effective for the sensemaking activities for which it was designed.
