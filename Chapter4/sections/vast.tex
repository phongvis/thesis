\section{Case Study 2: VAST Challenge 2014}
Shows an application of TimeSets to intelligence analysis. TimeSets is used to show both tweets (\note{this is the color blending version of TimeSets, not color gradient -- should we describe the color blending one?}, Figure~\ref{fig:savi}) and findings (\note{missing figure -- currently, findings are shown as a node-link diagram})
