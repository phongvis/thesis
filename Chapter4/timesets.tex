\chapter{Visualizing Temporal and Thematic Relationships}

\graphicspath{{Chapter4/figures/}}
%The timeline visualization in Chapter 4 cannot show events belonging to multiple sets. In this chapter, we introduce a novel timeline visualization technique, TimeSets, that helps make sense of complex temporal datasets by showing the set relationships among individual events. TimeSets visually groups events that share a topic, such as a place or a person, while preserving their temporal order. It dynamically adjusts the level of detail for each event to suit the amount of information and display estate.

%\section{Introduction}
%The current limitation
%
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item similarity: use colors or shapes to indicate sets -- not powerful 
%	\item proximity: not space-efficient
%	\item uniform connectedness: cluttered
%\end{itemize}
%
%The contribution: TimeSets
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item clearly shows the events within a set over time and their relationships with other sets; 
%	\item dynamically adjusts the level of details of each event to suit the amount of information and display estate;
%	\item uses color gradient backgrounds for events belonging to multiple sets and curved set outlines to emphasize its grouping.
%\end{itemize}

%	\caption{TimeSets visualization of the CIA leak case. The timeline contains events that happened from 2002 to 2007, each has a timestamp or an interval, a label, and topics such as ``White House''. Events are positioned along the horizontal time axis based on timestamps, and vertically grouped by topics. A time-point event is shown with a white circle to its left, and an interval event with a horizontal bar on top showing its timespan. Each topic has a unique color (see the legend in the bottom right corner), and events shared by two topics have gradient backgrounds, transitioning between the colors of the two topics.}

%\section{Layout}
%Describe the layout algorithm.
%
%\section{Evaluation}
%A controlled experiment with 30 participants to compare TimeSets and the state-of-the-art set visualization technique -- KelpFusion.
%
%\section{Case Study 1: Publication Data}
%Shows an application of TimeSets to publication data of 200 articles and 8 sets.
%
%\section{Case Study 2: VAST Challenge 2014}
%Shows an application of TimeSets to tweets data. 
%
%Also use TimeSets to show user findings [not done yet! currently, findings are shown as a node-link diagram.]
