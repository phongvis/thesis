The previous chapter presents a timeline visualization -- SchemaLine -- that enables users to explore the temporal relationship of sensemaking, especially in the context of intelligence analysis. It allows analysts to construct and refine schemas from the annotations that they made during analysis. However, SchemaLine cannot show annotations belonging to multiple schemas, limiting users from exploring more complex temporal relationship. 

This chapter introduces a novel technique -- \emph{\textcb{TimeSets}} -- to address that issue. TimeSets visually groups events that belong to the same schema, or \emph{set} for generality, but still preserves their temporal order. It color codes the backgrounds of the entire sets to distinguish them and uses colored gradient backgrounds for the intersections among those sets. It also addresses the scalability issue in SchemaLine by dynamically adjusting the level of detail for each event to suit the amount of information and display estate. To explore how TimeSets is used to support sensemaking, two case studies in different domains -- intelligence analysis and publication data exploration -- were carried out. Also, a controlled experiment was conducted to evaluate TimeSets against a state-of-the-art method. The results showed significant advantage in accuracy and user preference.
