\section{Analytic Provenance}
\label{sec:lr-analytic-provenance}
Analytic provenance focuses on understanding a user's reasoning process through the study of their interactions with a visualization~\cite{North2011}. It captures both the interactive data exploration process and the accompanied human reasoning process during sensemaking~\cite{Xu2015}. In this section, we discuss different models for representing analytic provenance data, methods to capture the data and different techniques to visualize the captured data for supporting sensemaking.

\subsection{Model}
Analytic provenance information can be categorized using a four-layer hierarchical model based on its semantic richness, proposed by Gotz and Zhou~\cite{Gotz2009}. \autoref{fig:lr-Gotz-Zhou-model} illustrates this model with the level of semantics increasing from bottom to top. The bottom-level \emph{events} consists of low-level user interactions such as mouse clicks and keystrokes, which have little semantic meaning. The next level up includes \emph{actions}, which are analytic steps such as querying the database or changing the zooming level of data visualization. The parameters such as data description and visualization settings are also part of the provenance. Further up are the \emph{sub-tasks}, which are the analyses required to achieve the sensemaking goal. Considering stock market analysis as the top-level \emph{task}, examples of sub-tasks could be identifying top performing companies and determining long term trends. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]

The bottom layer includes \emph{events} such as key presses and mouse clicks, which have little semantics. The next level up contains \emph{actions} such as the database query and visualization zooming. Further up level consists of \emph{sub-tasks}, which usually are the analyses performed during the sensemaking. The top level \emph{tasks} are the overall sensemaking undertaking. \is{Gotz2009}}
	\label{fig:lr-Gotz-Zhou-model}
\end{figure}

Analytic provenance is closely linked both within and across layers. Within a layer, analytic provenance is linked temporally (i.e., one event happens after another) and logically (e.g., one action depends on the two previous actions). A sequence of activities in each layer is performed to serve for a single activity in the next highest layer. For example, a database query action consists of several mouse click and key stroke events, and it is part of a higher level sub-task such as ``comparing stock performance''.

This four-layer model is general, allowing the designers to determine the specific activities they want to capture within each layer for their systems. For example, many existing taxonomies of visualization interaction and tasks can be used for the \emph{action} and \emph{sub-task} layers. Low-level analytic activities such as ``retrieve value'', ``sort'' and ``filter''~\cite{Amar2005, Gotz2009} can represent the \emph{action} layer. A taxonomy of interaction techniques based on their intent such as ``show me more related items'' may stay in-between the \emph{action} layer and \emph{sub-task} layer. A multi-level typology of abstract visualization tasks by Brehmer and Munzner~\cite{Brehmer2013} distinguishes why and how a task is performed, as well as what the task inputs and outputs are. The \emph{how} part of this typology is a good candidate for representing the \emph{action} layer, and the \emph{why} part may be suitable for the \emph{sub-task} layer.

A recent taxonomy by Ragan~et~al.~\cite{Ragan2016} characterizes provenance in visualization and analysis systems based on the type of provenance and the purpose of collecting it. Five ``flat'' provenance types include \emph{data}, \emph{visualization}, \emph{interaction}, \emph{insight} and \emph{rationale}. The type of data provenance is similar to what we describe previously in \autoref{sub:lr-data-provenane}. Visualization provenance concerns with the history of graphical views and visualization states, and interaction provenance focus on the history of user actions within a system. The combination of these two types of provenance is equivalent to the \emph{action} layer. Insight provenance describes the findings and rationale provenance explains the reasoning process that led to these findings. These two types of provenance are good candidates for the \emph{sub-task} layer.

\subsection{Capture}
Analytic provenance capture provides the data for its visualization. We describe capturing methods for each of the four layers in the Gotz and Zhou's model~\cite{Gotz2009}.

\subsubsection{Events}
There is limited literature on capturing events because it is relatively easy and provides little semantics alone. Among these, Glass Box~\cite{Cowley2006} can record a wide range of low-level events such as mouse clicks, key strokes and window events. Its objective is to capture and archive intelligence analysis activities so they can be retrieved later. Simply capturing these events alone is insufficient to understand their purpose and rationale. For example, we know that a \textit{mouse click} is captured; however, what the purpose of that click was (e.g., to sort the data), and why the user performed that click (e.g., to find an interesting pattern from the data) are unknown. Commonly, when analyzing data with a visualization, an analyst needs to perform many operations with trials and errors to find the answer to the problem. In that case, a series of poor-semantic events makes it more difficult for the analyst to recall what has been done. Therefore, more meaningful activities also need to be captured. 

\subsubsection{Actions}
During the course of analysis with a visualization, all user interactions can be systematically recorded. The visual exploration process can be modeled using a \textit{graph} metaphor. Nodes in the graph represent \textit{states} of the visualization and edges represent \textit{actions} that transform one state into another state. A state includes all the information required to reconstruct the captured visualization. For example, a state of a \textit{scatter plot} may include the dataset, attributes mapped to spatial positions, color and size. An action while interacting with a scatter plot could be changing attribute mapping of size. Commonly, \emph{undo/redo} features are provided to allow revisiting to previous states. If a new action is performed from a past state, a new branch will be created to store that new line of operations. 

Two common strategies can be applied to automatically capture the exploration process. The first strategy is to capture the initial state and all the actions so that they can be executed to reproduce any states~\cite{Kadivar2009}. This allows reapplying the analysis process with a different dataset, but could be time-inefficient if the number of actions is high. The second strategy is simply to capture all visualization states after each action~\cite{Bavoil2005}. This is easier to implement, but may be memory-expensive if a state contain too much information.

In the context of everyday, online sensemaking, users interact with a standard web browser instead of a visualization system. Visited web pages are automatically captured including visit time, web titles, URLs and favorite icons. Linking relationship between pages such as opening from a web link and using the browser's back button can also be captured~\cite{Ayers1995,Hightower1998,Milic-Frayling2003}. This results in a hierarchical history rather than a linear list of visited web pages in the standard history feature. Manual capture using bookmarks is also a standard feature of web browsers. It allows users to save web pages for revisitation purpose. Besides bookmarking a whole web page through its URL, a page element such as \textit{table} and \textit{form} HTML tags~\cite{Hong2008}, and a specific fragment of text~\cite{Dontcheva2006} can also be bookmarked. These finer-grained captures allow users to record what they want with higher accuracy. 

\subsubsection{Sub-Tasks and Tasks}
Tasks and sub-tasks provide important clues to the purpose and rationale underlying the sensemaking. They describe an abstract summary of the task-solving process. However, they are largely part of users' thinking, which a visual analytics system does not have direct access to. Also, the time window to capture such information is very limited. Even the users themselves may forget what they were doing after a while, making it difficult to recover the analytic provenance information. Therefore, capturing high-level tasks and sub-tasks is one of the biggest challenges in analytic provenance capture.

Existing approaches to capture high-level analytic provenance can be broadly categorized into \emph{manual} and \emph{automatic} methods. The manual methods largely rely on users recording their analysis processes and sensemaking tasks, whereas the automatic methods try to infer the higher level tasks and sub-tasks from lower level events and actions. Even though the manual approaches are usually more accurate, they can distract users from the actual analysis tasks, which may discourage users from recording analytic provenance. Alternatively, the automatic approaches do not introduce interruption to the sensemaking process, but their capability of inferring semantic-rich analytic provenance information is limited~\cite{Gotz2009}. Individual differences also introduce additional challenges to designing a robust algorithm for the inferring process. Users' knowledge and experience have a considerable impact on the way they conduct analyses. As a result, the sensemaking process (i.e. the analytic provenance) can vary significantly from users to users, even with the same dataset and analysis task. 

\paragraph{Manual}
User annotation is one of the most common forms in manual capture. Users create \emph{notes} or \emph{annotations} that are associated with certain data, analysis result, and/or visualization~\cite{Heer2009,Walker2013}. The content of a ``note'' is not limited to findings or discoveries; it can also include the thinking that leads to a finding or the relationships between findings. \emph{Data-aware annotation}~\cite{Heer2008a} links a finding and the associated visualization to the underlying data used to produce it, which makes it possible to apply new analysis and visual mapping at a later stage if further investigation is needed. 

Even though an individual note only represents a fraction of the analytic provenance, it is possible to provide a reasonably good overview of the sensemaking process if a number of notes and the connections between them are captured. For example, the \emph{Scalable Reasoning System} ~\cite{Pike2009} allows users to record their discoveries of interesting patterns about the data, then specify their causal relationships, and generate a hypothesis based on these artifacts. However, this is only useful when users are willing to take notes, which can be perceived as distractions sometimes. Two common strategies to alleviate this include minimizing interruption/cognitive effort~\cite{Hong2008} and providing immediate benefits to the sensemaking task such as planing exploratory analysis for complex tasks~\cite{Lunzer2014}. However, currently there is a lack of general design guidelines for how to achieve them, and there are few user studies evaluating how effective they are, in terms of both the benefits they bring and the potential cognitive cost they can introduce. 

\paragraph{Automatic}
One of the main disadvantages of manual capture is the requirement of direct input from users. Automatic approaches try to address this by inferring higher level analytic provenance from what can be automatically captured. As discussed earlier, it is easier to capture analytic provenance at the event and action level. Therefore, most automatic approaches try to infer sub-task and task-level information from event and action provenance.

This turns out to be a difficult challenge. An experiment studied how much of a user's reasoning process can be recovered from user action information~\cite{Dou2009}. A domain-specific sensemaking task was used and experts were recruited to analyze the user action log. Higher-level analytic provenance manually inferred from the interaction logs were compared with the ground truth obtained through interview. The results showed that 79 percent of the findings, 60 percent of the methods, and 60 percent of the strategies were correctly recovered. The accuracy is not high even in such a constrained setting with domain experts doing the inference. Given the diversity of data and analysis involved in the sensemaking and the difficult of replicating expert knowledge/thinking in a computer system, the chance of having a generic technique that can accurately infer semantic-rich analytic provenance information for a variety of analysis tasks is not high.

Instead, existing methods either constrain the problem/analysis domain or aim for less semantically rich analytic provenance. By limiting the choice of data and analysis/visualization, an inference algorithm has better chance to make the right guess. However, even within a specific domain (such as finance), the types of data and analyses involved are still of very large amount. Also, being limiting on the data and analysis can constrain the system capability, having a negative impact on the sensemaking task.

Given the difficulty of inferring task/sub-task information, a few methods target less semantic-rich provenance. One such example is \emph{action chunking}, i.e., identify a group of actions that are likely to part of the same sub-task, without knowing what the sub-task is. Such approaches apply heuristics to infer patterns from action logs based on repeated occurrence and proximity in data/visualization space or analysis time~\cite{Gotz2009}. Such chunking information can be useful in several ways. For example, the system can prompt user to take a note if such an action usually occurs within a specific sequence. Also, the grouping information can be used for aggregation when large amount of provenance information is to be visualized. This method is later extended to monitor user behavior for implicit signals of user intent and uses the information to suggests alternative visualization~\cite{Gotz2009}. It is an open research problem to explore similar analytic provenance that can be effectively inferred and provides semantic information that can be used for supporting sensemaking.

\subsection{Visualization}
We also characterize the visualization of provenance data based on the level of semantics involved in the collected data~\cite{Gotz2009}, including event, action, sub-task and task. Because low-level events contain little semantics, they are often visualized and analyzed after users finished their tasks in order to gain deeper understanding about their processes rather than to provide near real-time sensemaking support to the users during their tasks. For example, visualization of users' mouse clicks can reveal patterns of application usage~\cite{Matejka2013} and highlight some important usability issues, such as pages where users spent a lot of time and pages where they got lost during the task~\cite{Waterson2002}. User interactions with visual analytics systems can be visually examined to recover their reasoning processes employed in their analysis tasks such as specific findings they found and strategies they used~\cite{Dou2009, Guo2016}. Interaction logs have also been used to predict user performance of basic visualization tasks like visual search~\cite{Brown2014}.

Next, we focus on the visualization of levels with richer semantics. Actions and states
(the visualization results of the actions) are commonly used to show the analysis process. Sub-tasks and tasks are often documented by users in a graphical reasoning process.

\subsubsection{Visualization of the Analysis Process}

\paragraph{Visual Representation}

\subparagraph{Text}
Text is commonly used to describe actions or states, such as names of actions, titles of visited web pages and content of user notes. Text can provide accurate information, but long text makes it difficult for users to understand and recognize. A graphical browser history by Ayers and Stasko~\cite{Ayers1995} shortens web page titles to accommodate more pages in the view. Within a given width, its algorithm preserves complete words at both ends of the title and trims characters in the middle if necessary. Kaasten, Greenberg and Edwards~\cite{Kaasten2001} compare the recognizability of titles between various string sizes for all three truncation methods (text is truncated at the beginning, middle or end of the title). The results show that for medium (60\%) recognition, we need 15--20 letters (depending on
the truncation method) for web sites, and 28--39 letters for
exact pages. For longer text such as user notes, machine learning techniques for text summarization could be beneficial~\cite{Nenkova2012}.

\subparagraph{Icon}
Sensemaking actions can be represented by graphical symbols, allowing users to easily distinguish them. They can be used alone to represent the analysis process when the visual result of each action is out of interest (\autoref{fig:lr-action-1}). Alternatively, these icons can be used together with interface states, connecting the one before and the one after an action (\autoref{fig:lr-action-2}).

\begin{figure}[!htb]

\subcaptionbox{A sequence of icons displaying the analysis process. \is{Gotz2009}\label{fig:lr-action-1}}{\includegraphics[width=.8\columnwidth]{action-1}}

\vspace{.5\baselineskip}

\subcaptionbox{Iconic actions connecting two visualization states. \is{Ma1999}\label{fig:lr-action-2}}{\includegraphics[width=.8\columnwidth]{action-2}}
\caption{Using icons for representing actions.}
\end{figure}


\subparagraph{Thumbnail}
Thumbnails are commonly used to represent visualization states, aiding users' recognition of previous ones. One study suggests that a thumbnail size of 96 pixels square could provide 60\% accurate recognition of a visited web site~\cite{Kaasten2001}. For the same accuracy but in recognizing an exact web page, the thumbnail size rises to 144 pixels square. Additional information can be added to a web thumbnail to improve its recognition such as how often the represented page is revisited and whether that page is bookmarked or not~\cite{Cockburn1999}. For visualization thumbnails, visual encodings and parameters that were used to produce the visualization can also be embedded (\autoref{fig:lr-thumbnail-encoding}), providing more provenance information to the users.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{thumbnail-encoding}
	\caption{Visualization thumbnails with additional information about any filtering used, the characteristics of the filtered subset of data and the visual encoding. \is{Walker2013}}
	\label{fig:lr-thumbnail-encoding}
\end{figure}

It may be necessary to apply pre- and post-processing adjustments to make the visualization thumbnails more recognizable~\cite{Heer2008}. For example, high-frequency visual elements that are not helpful in a small size such as gridlines and element borders can be removed to prevent their domination in the resulting thumbnail. As a result of down-sampling techniques, colors of data items may be different from them in the original visualization. Therefore, readjusting the color to match its intended value could help users to recognize the visualizations they analyzed in the past.

The default snapshot may also be an imperfect representation of a web page, especially if it contains a lot of text. Teevan~et~al.~\cite{Teevan2009} propose an automatic method to produce a thumbnail improving its recognition. It consists of three components: some salient text at the top-left hand corner, a salient image below the text, and a watermarked logo superimposed at the bottom left hand corner of the image. The salient text contains about 20 first characters of the web page title. The salient image and the branding logo are chosen from the page using machine learning. \autoref{fig:lr-enhanced-thumbnail} shows such a thumbnail.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics{enhanced-thumbnail}
	\caption{An enhanced web thumbnail (right) as a composite of some salient text, a salient image and a branding logo. \is{Teevan2009}}
	\label{fig:lr-enhanced-thumbnail}
\end{figure}

Besides recognizing previous states, seeing the difference between a state and the one before it is also important in understanding the analysis process. One approach is to highlight the difference between two consecutive states (\autoref{fig:lr-state-2}). The changes may only happen at one small portion of the entire interface. Therefore, showing only that area in both states could help users quickly identify the difference (\autoref{fig:lr-state-3}).

\begin{figure}[!htb]

\caption{Techniques improving recognition of state changes.}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Layout}

\subparagraph{Linear Layout}
Provenance data usually contains an inherent \emph{time} attribute, recording when an action happened. An approach that emphasizes on the order of completed actions is to show them as a linear sequence of items like a comic strip~\cite{Kurlander1988,Meng1998}. This layout facilitates visual scanning of past actions, allowing users to quickly understand the analysis process. \autoref{fig:lr-comic-strip} shows such a layout.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{comic-strip}
	\caption{Comic strip layout. A sequence of past actions in chronological order. \is{Heer2008}}
	\label{fig:lr-comic-strip}
\end{figure}

If the absolute timestamps of actions are of interest, a continuous timeline~\cite{Derthick2001} is a more suitable layout. Actions are positioned along the time axis at when they happen (\autoref{fig:lr-continuous-timeline-1}) or during which they last (\autoref{fig:lr-continuous-timeline-2}). The time axis can be either horizontal or vertical~\cite{SandboxTimeline2012}. The layout algorithms found in these provenance timelines are quite naive. POLESTAR~\cite{Pioch2006} and the timeline from Jigsaw~\cite{Liu2010} require manual rearrangement of the events from users to solve the overlapping problem. The timeline from nSpace2 Sandbox~\cite{SandboxTimeline2012} shows events at the exact time when they happen without considering possible intersection between of them.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\centering
\subcaptionbox{Time-point provenance data. User annotations are positioned along a time axis at when their associated events happen. \is{Gotz2006}\label{fig:lr-continuous-timeline-1}}{\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{continuous-timeline-1}}

\vspace{.5\baselineskip}

\subcaptionbox{Interval provenance data. User actions are shown as horizontal bars a long a time axis covering their durations. \is{Plaisant1999}\label{fig:lr-continuous-timeline-2}}{\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{continuous-timeline-2}}
\caption{Timeline layout for visualizing the analysis process.}
\end{figure}

Another approach is to use both the horizontal and vertical axes to represent time. BrowseLine~\cite{Hoeber2009} uses the vertical axis for \emph{macro-time} and the horizontal axis for \emph{micro-time}, similar to stem-and-leaf plots. More specifically, a two-dimensional timeline (\autoref{fig:lr-timeline-2d}) is divided into rows, each for a big time-slot, such as one hour. In each row, events happening within that hour are positioned along the horizontal axis without considering their absolute timestamps. This design assumes that users may only remember roughly when events happen, thus absolute positioning in the vertical axis facilitate them in recognizing past events. Moreover, relative positioning in the horizontal axis could help pack more events and prevent overlapping.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{timeline-2d}
	\caption{2D timeline. The vertical axis represents macro-time, whereas the horizontal axis represents micro-time. Events within a macro time-slot are positioned in chronological order as a comic strip. \is{Hoeber2009}}
	\label{fig:lr-timeline-2d}
\end{figure}

\subparagraph{Branching Layout}
Many sensemaking systems allow users to revisit their past states such as through undo/redo features or backward/forward in web browsers. From a past state, if the user performs a new action, it should be recorded in a new branch forking from that state. This branching history is typically visualized with a tree layout to represent the logic of the analysis process effectively. In such a tree, nodes represent a summary of system states, and edges represent actions that transition the system from one state
to another. Examples can be found in provenance-enabled systems in different fields including scientific visualization~\cite{Ma1999}, information visualization~\cite{Dunne2012}, visual analytics~\cite{Kadivar2009} and browser history~\cite{Ayers1995}. \autoref{fig:lr-tree-prov} shows such a provenance tree.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.7\columnwidth]{tree}
	\caption{Tree visualization for branching analysis process. Nodes are thumbnails of past visualization states and links are transforming actions. \is{Jankun-Kelly2007}}
	\label{fig:lr-tree-prov}
\end{figure}

% Time encoding
In a tree layout, the order of actions can be inferred through the direction of edges. Moreover, exact time gap between actions can also be visually encoded into the visualization. VisTrails~\cite{Bavoil2005} color-codes the background of nodes according to their creation time (\autoref{fig:lr-tree-time-1}). Aruvi~\cite{Shrinivasan2008} uses the length of edges to represent the relative time gap between two states (\autoref{fig:lr-tree-time-2}). 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\centering
\subcaptionbox{Node backgrounds are color coded based on time. \is{UniversityofUtah2012}\label{fig:lr-tree-time-1}}{\includegraphics[height=0.21\columnwidth]{tree-time-1}}

\caption{Encoding temporal information into provenance trees.}
\end{figure}

% Other variations
The diagonal arrangement of tree as in~\autoref{fig:lr-tree} may consume a lot of space. One approach is to use only horizontal and vertical edges as in~\autoref{fig:lr-tree-time-2}. Another approach is to display only the path that led to the currently active  visualization~\cite{Klemmer2002}. Other paths can be expanded on demand. \autoref{fig:lr-inline-history-2} shows examples of representations of the active path and the full history.

\begin{figure}[!htb]

\caption{Branching layout for tree visualization of the analysis process. \is{Klemmer2002}}
\end{figure}

% Interaction for scalability
Interaction is also commonly used to address the scalability issue. Zooming and panning allow users to see the overview of the analysis process and navigate to the part of interest~\cite{Dunne2012}. Collapsing and expanding branches of the tree on demand can also help reduce its size and avoid distraction~\cite{Bavoil2005}. Distortion techniques may help users to quickly navigate and focus on more relevant states and actions~\cite{Meng1998}. Another technique for compressing the provenance tree and improving user understanding is \emph{action chunking}~\cite{Heer2008}: a sequence of related actions may be better represented as a single higher-level action. For example, a quick succession of sort or filter actions likely indicate a multi-step configuration of the view and can be chunked together.

Typically, provenance data is shown in a separate view, linked with other data views of the visualization system~\cite{Shrinivasan2008,Heer2008,Pike2009,Kadivar2009}. However the system can also be used as a single item of the provenance view. For instance, in GraphTrail~\cite{Dunne2012} -- a single-view visualization system, when the visualization is changed (e.g., changing attribute mapping in a bar chart), it creates a new view containing that visualization and links with the current view. This is similar to how normally the provenance view is developed; however, GraphTrail makes the entire exploration space become the provenance view. Moreover, each history item is not a thumbnail, but a fully interactive visualization. By allowing zooming and panning, users can choose between a close examination of individual system states (\autoref{fig:lr-detail}) and an overview of the analysis structure (\autoref{fig:lr-overview}). An extra overview window as in overview-and-detail technique~\cite{Cockburn2008} could be useful in search and navigation in a large space.

\caption{Unification of the exploration view and the history view. \is{Dunne2012}}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Visualization of the Reasoning Process}
The reasoning process reflects user findings, methods and strategies in performing a task. This process mainly happens in the user's mind, and some sensemaking systems allow the user to manually externalize it through user bookmark~\cite{Walker2013}, annotation~\cite{Heer2009}, and manipulation of those externalized items~\cite{Xu2014}. A common form of reasoning externalization is to allow the user to write down their thinking. It could be a free note~\cite{Shrinivasan2008} or a description of a user bookmarked visualization~\cite{Walker2013}. Alternatively, users can annotate directly on the visual bookmark using standard graphical editing features such as circling on interesting patterns (\autoref{fig:lr-annotation-1} -- Top) or hand drawing on a suspicious trend (\autoref{fig:lr-annotation-1} -- Bottom). To make the annotation meaningful across multiple views, the selection should be aware of the data involved in it~\cite{Heer2008a}. For example, in~ \autoref{fig:lr-annotation-2}, the annotation in the top view also makes the data items in the bottom view get annotated using the same selection query. Data-aware annotations allow users to see the data of interest remained across different views.

\begin{figure}[!htb]

\caption{User annotation of bookmarked visualization.\is{Heer2012}}
\label{fig:lr-annotation}
\end{figure}

% Interaction
A note can simply be any user thought, but it can also take on different roles such as \emph{evidence}, \emph{assumption} and \emph{hypothesis}~\cite{Pike2009}. They have different visual representations, enabling users create and manage their complex reasoning processes. Typically, users are allowed to move notes freely and draw edges to connect them, enabling spatial grouping of related notes and relationships establishment. These interactive features are known to help users produce more critical thinking in their analyses~\cite{Sedig2013}. For example, users can show connections between a hypothesis and its evidence by drawing links, and spatially separate the evidence into a supporting group and a counter group, facilitating further comparison. \autoref{fig:lr-reasoning-simple-note} shows such a diagram produced with user notes and \autoref{fig:lr-reasoning-diagram-SRS} shows such a more formal diagram with different reasoning roles.

\begin{figure}[!htb]

\caption{Visualization of reasoning process.}
\end{figure}

% Formal reasoning
More analytical reasoning methods have also been applied on the provenance data. The SRS system~\cite{Pike2009} first allows the user to construct a reasoning diagram with bookmarked visualizations as evidence nodes and causal relationships as links (\autoref{fig:lr-reasoning-diagram-SRS}). These evidence nodes and links may lead to a hypothesis. The user then specifies their confidence about the evidence before the system computes the likelihood of the hypothesis using the Dempster–Shafer belief network~\cite{Sanfilippo2007}. The result provides analytical support to the user. 

POLESTAR~\cite{Pioch2006} supports argument structuring, based on methods for analyzing legal documents such as the Toulmin model of argument~\cite{Toulmin2003}. To help validate a hypothesis, it organizes arguments as a tree structure of claims, each supported by at least one piece of evidence. A claim can have its supporting sub-claims and can also have rebuttals that weaken or restrict their force. \autoref{fig:lr-reasoning-argument-editor} shows such a argument tree. Sandbox~\cite{Wright2006} supports analysis of competing hypotheses -- a judgment method that requires careful weighing of alternative explanations~\cite{Heuer1999}. It allows users to add multiple hypotheses, each with supporting or contradictory evidence. These pieces evidence are weighted by the users and summarized in a visual matrix, enabling the users to effectively make a decision without having to remember and analyze in their minds. \autoref{fig:lr-reasoning-ACH} shows an example of this support.
