\section{Provenance}
In the Oxford dictionary, \emph{provenance} is defined as ``the place of origin or earliest known history of something''. Provenance plays an important role in many aspects of our daily lives. For example, in \emph{food} industry, before purchasing a bottle of fruit juice, it is useful for the customers to know about its origin, ingredients, methods of collecting, storing and processing fruits, etc. In the context of \emph{art}, the provenance information of a painting such as authorship, material, painting time and the story behind the painting greatly decides its value. In computer systems, the provenance of a piece of data is defined as ``the process that led to that piece of data''~\cite{Moreau2011}. We broadly categorize provenance into two groups. The first group, \emph{data provenance}, uses the computer systems definition of provenance including the source information of data and the process that produced it. The second group, \emph{analytic provenance}, focuses on visualization and analysis including the higher level reasoning involved in the analysis process and the interactive data exploration driven by sensemaking.

\subsection{Data Provenance}
\label{sub:lr-data-provenane}
Data provenance research has been taken in different fields, notably scientific workflows and databases. Scientific experiments may consist of thousands of steps, with each step involving distributed data sources and computational data models~\cite{Gil2007}. Workflows have been used to facilitate the assembly, automation and management of such experiments. Notable scientific workflow systems with provenance enabled include Tarvena~\cite{Zhao2008}, Kepler~\cite{Bowers2006} and VisTrails~\cite{Bavoil2005}. Provenance plays an important role in scientific workflows, aiming to support data interpretation, reproduction of experiment results, troubleshooting and optimization~\cite{Miles2007}. The provenance of long and complex workflows is huge, thus pose challenges in storing, querying, and making sense of such data~\cite{Davidson2007}.

Curated databases are populated and updated with a great deal of human effort, typically published on the web~\cite{Buneman2008}. A well-known example is Wikipedia -- a free Internet encyclopedia that allows its users to edit almost any article accessible. Each record in these databases, such as a Wikipedia article, may be edited by many users and referred to other internal and external sources. This produces problems in attribution and provenance: who edited what at when. Research in database provenance can be characterized into a why-where-how framework~\cite{Cheney2007}. \emph{Why}-provenance focuses on the lineage of the output: for each tuple $t$ in the output, the lineage of $t$ is a set of tuples in the input data that helps produce $t$~\cite{Cui2000}. \emph{How}-provenance concerns how the output tuple $t$ is derived from the query~\cite{Green2007}. Finally, \emph{where}-provenance describes specific locations, or cells in relational databases, of the input data that contribute to the query output~\cite{Buneman2001}. To compute these types of provenance, two general approaches have been introduced~\cite{Buneman2008}. An \emph{eager} approach adjusts the query to pass the extra provenance information to the output. Whereas, a \emph{lazy} approach computes provenance on demand.

Data provenance research in scientific workflows and databases has mainly focused on closed systems, which have full access to the data and its provenance. Modern applications with service-oriented~\cite{Papazoglou2007} and cloud-computing~\cite{Buyya2009} architectures bring challenges in tracking and exchanging provenance information across systems. The \emph{Open Provenance Model} is designed to address these challenges~\cite{Moreau2011}. It also supports a digital representation of provenance for any objects, whether produced by computer systems or not. Three types of objects are defined in the model for building this representation. An \emph{artifact} is a state that can be a digital or physical object. A \emph{process} is a series of actions performed on or caused by artifacts, and resulting in new artifacts. An \emph{agent} acts as a catalyst of a process, managing its execution. Different types of causal relationships can be added between these nodes, forming a \emph{provenance graph} as shown in \autoref{fig:lr-provenance-graph}.

The Open Provenance Model has been implemented in many systems, including notable scientific workflows such as Tarvena~\cite{Zhao2008}, Kepler~\cite{Bowers2006} and VisTrails~\cite{Bavoil2005}. The model is general and can be extended in both the structure and vocabulary to represent domain-specific problems. \emph{D-profile}~\cite{Groth2011} describes an extension of the model for representing provenance in distributed systems. ProveML~\cite{Walker2013} is another extension for recording the provenance of data, analytical process and interpretations in human terrain visual analytics.
