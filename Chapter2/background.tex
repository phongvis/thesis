\chapter{Literature Review}
\section{Sensemaking}
- Overview of sensemaking

- Pirolli and Card's model

- Data--frame model

\section{Visualization and Visual Analytics}
- Overview of vis, scivis, infovis, visual analytics

- Show how they're used to support sensemaking

\section{Analytic Provenance}
- overview of provenance, other types of provenance, then analytic provenance

- modeling of analytic provenance: 4-level model by Gotz and Zhou and other vis task/action taxonomies
% such as classic Shneiderman's task by data type~\cite{Shneiderman1996}, Amar's low-level~\cite{Amar2005}, Amar's high-level~\cite{Amar2004}, more recent Bhemer's typology what-why-how~\cite{Brehmer2013}.

- pipeline: capture - visualize - reuse and a summary of 'capture' and 'reuse'.

the three next sections are details about 'visualize'

\section{Exploring Temporal Relationship of Provenance Data}
Overview of different techniques to visualize temporal data

Focusing on timeline

Timeline for sensemaking

\section{Visualizing Temporal and Thematic Relationship of Provenance Data}
Set visualization

Timelines with set relations

\section{Understanding User Reasoning through Provenance Data} 
Recovering user reasoning through interaction logs

VA systems providing 'reasoning workspace'

Other non-visualization (data mining) work
