\chapter{Background}
\section{Sensemaking}
- Overview of sensemaking

- Pirolli and Card's model

- Data--frame model

\section{Visualization and Visual Analytics}
- Overview of vis, scivis, infovis, visual analytics

- Show how they're used to support sensemaking

\section{Analytic Provenance}
- overview of provenance, other types of provenance, then analytic provenance

- modeling of analytic provenance: 4-level model by Gotz and Zhou and other vis task/action taxonomies
% such as classic Shneiderman's task by data type~\cite{Shneiderman1996}, Amar's low-level~\cite{Amar2005}, Amar's high-level~\cite{Amar2004}, more recent Bhemer's typology what-why-how~\cite{Brehmer2013}.

- pipeline: capture - visualize - reuse and a summary of capture and reuse. [Visualize stage is the main focus on this thesis thus should have more discussion than other parts. Move it to a separate chapter to make sections balanced and also avoid one extra nested level of numbering.]
