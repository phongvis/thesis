First, this chapter reviews the core work in sensemaking and visualization. Then, it discusses the literature on analytic provenance with a focus on visualization of provenance data for supporting sensemaking. Finally, it presents visualization techniques of time-oriented and network data because these two data types are heavily involved in the research problem of the thesis.
