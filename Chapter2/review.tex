In this chapter, we first discuss the core work in sensemaking and visualization.  Then, we review literature on analytic provenance with a focus on using visualization of provenance data to support sensemaking. Finally, we present visualization techniques of time-oriented and network data because these two data types are heavily involved in our research problem.
