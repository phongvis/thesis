In this chapter, we first discuss the core work in individual fields related to our research problem including sensemaking, visualization and analytic provenance. Then, we focus on the intersection of these three fields: visualization of provenance data for supporting sensemaking. At the end, we present visualization techniques of general time-oriented and network data because these two data types possess similar characteristics as provenance data.
