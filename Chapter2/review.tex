%\section{Sensemaking}
%
%[this should be in the introduction]
%Provide some definitions of sensemaking, from a very abstract one to a process-oriented one. [need to  rephrase]
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item How do we make sense of the world so we can act in it ~\cite{Snowden2005}
%	\item Sensemaking is a motivated, continuous effort to understand connections (which can be among people, places, and events) in order to anticipate their trajectories and act effectively ~\cite{Klein2006a}
%	\item It's the way people go about their process of collecting, organizing and creating representations of complex information sets, all centered around some problem they need to understand~\cite{Russell2008}
%\end{itemize}
%
%Sensemaking in different contexts with different perspectives. 2-3 lines for each:  information science~\cite{Dervin1983}, human-computer interaction~\cite{Russell1993}, and organizational studies~\cite{Weick1995}. Point to the recent review~\cite{Maitlis2014}.
%
%Next, review in details two sensemaking models that complement each other and have been highly accepted in the visualization community.
% 
%\subsection{Data--Frame Model}
%Klein et al.~\cite{Klein2003} defines sensemaking as a deliberate effort to understand an event, starting when a person realizes the gap of their current understanding of that event. These sensemaking activities are summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:data-frame-model}.

%	\label{fig:data-frame-model}
%\end{figure}
%
%\subsection{Pirolli and Card's Model}
%Pirolli and Card~\cite{Pirolli2005} describe sensemaking as a process consisting of two major loops: the foraging loop and the sensemaking loop (Figure~\ref{fig:pirolli-card-model}).

%
%\section{Visualization and Visual Analytics}
%
%\subsection{Visualization}
%Defines vis~\cite{Munzner2014}. difference between scivis and infovis. Classic example: Minard's map of Napoleon's march.
%
%How does vis support analysis?~\cite{Card1999} Classic example Anscombe's quartet
%
%The value of vis (Wijk, Fekete)
%
%vis reference model~\cite{Card1999}

%\subsection{Visual Analytics}
%Define v/a~\cite{Thomas2005, Keim2010}
%
%Describe visual analytics process model (Figure~\ref{fig:visual-analytics-process})
%

%
%%some components of visual analytics (from William's slides) (they're similar to the new definition of visual analytics in Mastering the Information Age
%%"Visual analytics combines automated analysis with interactive visualizations for an effective understanding, reasoning and decision making on the basis of very large and complex
%%datasets.")
%%\begin{itemize}
%%	\item data analysis/data mining
%%	\item interactive dynamics (Heer and Shneiderman) 
%%	\item assembly of evidence, argumentation (toulmin, wigmore)
%%\end{itemize}
%
%Next, we discuss three essential aspects of visualization research that also contribute to our proposed solutions described in upcoming chapters: information design principles, interaction techniques, and methods to evaluate visualizations.
%
%\subsection{Information Design Principles}
%Structure of this section:
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item Discuss visual channels that are used to represent individual data items, and the channel rankings	encoding channel ranking (Section 5.4.2 Munzner book)
%	\item Discuss a special channel -- color -- that is commonly used in both numerical and categorical data. This channel is heavily used in our designs described in upcoming chapters.
%	\item Discuss Gestalt principles that are used to represent groups of data items
%	\item Putting things together, Tufte's design principles for a well-design graphic
%	\item In a broader context, GUI design principles:  Schneiderman~\cite{Shneiderman2016} (eight golden rules), Norman (six design principles) ~\cite{Norman2002} and	Nielsen (ten usability heuristics)~\cite{Nielsen1994} -- create a table with rows showing similar principles

%%that organises once knowledge of the world.

%
%\subsection{Interaction Techniques}
%What is interaction?~\cite{Pike2009a} Why is it useful?~\cite{Munzner2014}. 
%
%Give examples from standard graphical user interfaces: highlight, zoom, scroll to vis-specific ones: brushing/linking, focus+context. [Use pictures for the vis-specific].
%
%Some taxonomies: [make a table to show similar techniques in the same row]
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Dix and Ellis~\cite{Dix1998}: Highlighting and focus, accessing extra
%	information -- drill down and hyperlinks, overview
%	and context -- zooming and fish-eye views, same representation / changing
%	parameters, same data / changing representation,
%	linking representation â€“ temporal fusion
%	\item Keim~\cite{Keim2002}: Dynamic projections, interactive filtering,
%	interactive zooming, interactive distortion,
%	interactive linking and brushing
%	\item Wilkinson~\cite{Wilkinson2005}: Filtering, navigating (zooming/panning/lens),
%	manipulating (node dragging/categorical
%	reordering), brushing and linking, animating, rotating, transforming
%\end{itemize}
%
%Interaction is executed to achieve some goal, thus can also be classified based on its intent. Give an example that several techniques are used to serve a single purpose. This kind of classification helps visualization designers select suitable interaction techniques to serve for the capabilities they want to offer to the users.
%
%%For example, unfolding sub-categories in an interactive pie
%%chart [15], drill-down in a treemap [36], and semantic zooming [32]
%%all may appear very different, but we argue that they serve the same
%%purpose, getting more details.
%
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Yi et al.~\cite{Yi2007}: 1) Select, 2) Explore, 3) Reconfigure, 4) Encode, 5) Abstract/Elaborate, 6) Filter, and 7)
%Connect
%	\item Heer and Shneiderman~\cite{Heer2012}:  Visualize. Filter. Sort. Derive. Select. Navigate. Coordinate. Organize. Record. Annotate. Share. Guide.
%	\item Brehmer and Munzner~\cite{Brehmer2013}: encode, select, navigate, arrange, change, filter, aggregate, annotate, import, derive, record
%\end{itemize}
%
%
%%At one level, interaction typically refers to the set of controls
%%provided to the user to manipulate an interface and the relationship
%%between the user and that interface. At a more abstract level, there is the
%%interaction between the user and the problem space. This higher-level interaction
%%is a cognitive act that is enabled by computational tools, but it does
%%not take place exclusively within them (nor, for that m
%%
%%
%%Interactivity is crucial for building vis tools that handle complexity.
%%When datasets are large enough, the limitations of both people
%%and displays preclude just showing everything at once; interaction
%%where user actions cause the view to change is the way forward.
%%Moreover, a single static view can show only one aspect of
%%a dataset. For some combinations of simple datasets and tasks,
%%the user may only need to see a single visual encoding. In contrast,
%%an interactively changing display supports many possible
%%queries.
%%In all of these cases, interaction is crucial. For example, an interactive
%%vis tool can support investigation at multiple levels of detail,
%%ranging from a very high-level overview down through multiple
%%levels of summarization to a fully detailed view of a small part of it.
%%It can also present different ways of representing and summarizing
%%the data in a way that supports understanding the connections
%%between these alternatives.
%
%Discuss approaches that can improve many different interaction techniques: direct manipulation~\cite{Shneiderman1982, Kwon2011}, fluid interaction~\cite{Elmqvist2011}
%
%Discuss cognitive utilities associated with interaction~\cite{Sedig2013} -- many techniques can facilitate sensemaking, reasoning, learning, etc.
%
%Putting all together, combination of interaction techniques to explore data: Shneiderman's visual information seeking mantra: Overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand~\cite{Shneiderman1996}. And an alternative approach suitable for large datasets: Search, Show Context, Expand on Demand ~\cite{VanHam2009}
%
%\subsection{Evaluation of Visualizations}
%Structure:
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item what is evaluation and why is it important? (Munzner book)
%%	\item different kinds of evaluation, taxonomies based on techniques~\cite{Carpendale2008}, design stages~\cite{Munzner2009}, scenarios~\cite{Lam2012}
%	\item discuss the nested model of validation~\cite{Munzner2009} -- evaluation happens at different stages of the design process
%	\item discuss the seven scenarios of evaluation ~\cite{Lam2012}
%	\item discuss the 'user performance' scenario, which is used in TimeSets [refer to quantitative methods]
%	\item discuss the 'visual data analysis and reasoning' scenario, or evaluating sensemaking, which is used in SL, SP, SM -- refer to the sensemaking measurement paper ~\cite{Wilson2013}[refer to qualitative methods]
%\end{enumerate}
%

%
%%I think set visualizations will be described in the related work of TimeSets and qualtitative research in SensePath
%
%
%%We considered timeline visualization techniques that use the two most powerful Gestalt principles of grouping in the evaluation. For the \emph{proximity} principle, as discussed in the related work\note{update}, LifeLines~\cite{Plaisant1996a} cannot show multiple-set events, and storyline visualizations~\cite{Liu2013} only work with interval events. For the \emph{uniform connectedness} principle, methods that connect all events belonging to the same set together without using a designated layout to reduce edge crossings such as tmViewer~\cite{Kumar1998} produce a cluttered visualization.
