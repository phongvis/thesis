In this chapter, we first discuss the core work in individual topics related to our research problem including sensemaking, visualization and provenance. Then, we focus on their intersection -- analytic provenance -- with capture and visualization of provenance data for supporting sensemaking. Finally, we present visualization techniques of general time-oriented and network data because these two data types are part of our research problem as discussed in \autoref{chap:intro}.
