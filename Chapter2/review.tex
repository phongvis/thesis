This chapter begins with a discussion on the core work in sensemaking and visualization. Then, it reviews literature on analytic provenance with a focus on visualizing provenance data to support sensemaking. Finally, it presents visualization techniques of time-oriented and network data because these two data types are heavily involved in the research problem of the thesis.
