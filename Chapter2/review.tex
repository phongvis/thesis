\section{Sensemaking}
Overview of sensemaking

\subsection{Pirolli and Card's Model}
Pirolli and Card~\cite{Pirolli2005} describe sensemaking as a process consisting of two major loops: the foraging loop and the sensemaking loop (Figure~\ref{fig:pirolli-card-model}). 

\begin{figure}[!htb]

	\caption{A sensemaking model proposed by Pirolli and Card. \emph{Source:~\cite{Pirolli2005}}.}
	\label{fig:pirolli-card-model}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Data--Frame Model}
Klein et al.~\cite{Klein2003} defines sensemaking as a deliberate effort to understand an event, starting when a person realizes the gap of their current understanding of that event. These sensemaking activities are summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:data-frame-model}. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]

	\includegraphics[width=.8\columnwidth]{data-frame-model}
	\caption{The data--frame model. \emph{Source:~\cite{Klein2003}}.}
	\label{fig:data-frame-model}
\end{figure}

\section{Visualization and Visual Analytics}
\begin{itemize}
	\item defines visualization~\cite{Munzner2014}
	\item how vis helps support analysis~\cite{Card1999}
	\item vis reference model~\cite{Card1999}
	\item difference between scivis and infovis
	\item define visual analytics~\cite{Thomas2005, Keim2010}
	\item visual analytics process model (Figure~\ref{fig:visual-analytics-process})
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{visual-analytics-process}
	\caption{The data--frame model. \emph{Source:~\cite{Klein2003}}.}
	\label{fig:visual-analytics-process}
\end{figure}

some components of visual analytics (from William's slides) (they're similar to the new definition of visual analytics in Mastering the Information Age
"Visual analytics combines automated analysis with interactive visualizations for an effective understanding, reasoning and decision making on the basis of very large and complex
datasets.")
\begin{itemize}
	\item data analysis/data mining
	\item interactive dynamics (Heer and Shneiderman) 
	\item assembly of evidence, argumentation (toulmin, wigmore)
\end{itemize}

\section{Information Design Principles}
\begin{itemize}
	\item encoding channel ranking (chap 5, 6 Munzner book)
%	\item some of 'rules of thumbs' in her book as well
	\item Focus+Context
	\item Gestalt Principles
	\item Principle of Visual Affordance
	\item Tufte: ink-ratio
	\item Ben Shneiderman’s influential mantra of Overview First, Zoom and Filter, Details on Demand
\end{itemize}

%Working memory becomes an important factor as it organise and process information
%when learning occurs (Global, 2000). Here information is sorted and organised into
%relevant schema. Schemas can be referred to as models or hypothetical structures
%that organises once knowledge of the world.

\section{Analytic Provenance}
Overview of provenance -- provenance in ordinary context, give examples (painting)

Some types of provenance: database, workflow, semantic web (see the previous review of analytic provenance)

Then analytic provenance: definition from ~\cite{North2011}, our agenda~\cite{Xu2015}

Modeling of analytic provenance: 4-level model by Gotz and Zhou and other vis task/action taxonomies such as classic Shneiderman's task by data type~\cite{Shneiderman1996}, Amar's low-level~\cite{Amar2005}, Amar's high-level~\cite{Amar2004}, more recent Bhemer's typology what-why-how~\cite{Brehmer2013}.

Pipeline: capture - visualize - use and a summary of 'capture' and 'use' (except for directly supporting sensemaking)

\subsection{Capture}
combine previous reviews from the draft survey of analytic provenance, research agenda, and capture in the context of online sensenmaking the last paper
\subsection{Use}
work from the draft survey of analytic provenance: reusing the performed analysis (workflow), making tutorial, presentation

\section{Visualizing Temporal Relationship of Sensemaking}
\paragraph{Visualization of Temporal Events}
\begin{itemize}
	\item sequential timeline as comic strips
	\begin{itemize}
		\item overview: ~\cite{McCloud1993}
		\item  examples:~\cite{Gotz2010}, DIVA~\cite{Walker2013}
	\end{itemize}
	\item continuous timeline
	\begin{itemize}
		\item one of the earliest classic examples: Chart of Biography~\cite{Priestley1765}, Gantt chart~\cite{Gantt1913}
		\item (events as glyphs) early visualization: LifeLines~\cite{Plaisant1996, Plaisant1998} and its extensions LifeLines2~\cite{Wang2008, Wang2009}, Similan~\cite{Wongsuphasawat2009}, LifeFlow~\cite{Wongsuphasawat2011}, for interval events: EventFlow~\cite{Monroe2013} [describe what's new in them]
		\item (events as user annotations) POLESTAR~\cite{Pioch2006}, HARVEST~\cite{Gotz2006}, Jigsaw~\cite{Stasko2007, Gorg2013}, and nSpace2 Sandbox~\cite{Wright2006, SandboxTimeline2012} -- how do they support sensemaking?
		\item some online services
	\end{itemize}
	\item Storyline: show temporal dynamics of social interactions~\cite{Munroe2009, Tanahashi2012, Liu2013}
	\item ThemeRiver: show thematic changes in large document collections -- aggregate a number of events into intervals, kind of smooth histogram~\cite{Havre2002, Byron2008}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Viusialization of Event Relationships}
\begin{itemize}
	\item drawing edges between related events: tmViewer~\cite{Kumar1998}
	\item mutliple facets, views with different scales: Continuum~\cite{Andre2007}
	\item time-dependent and time-independent (how?): SemaTime~\cite{Stab2010}
\end{itemize}

\section{Visualizing User Reasoning in Sensemaking}
\paragraph{Visualization of Non-Linear Sensemaking Process}
Visualize the branching history
\begin{itemize}
	\item typically, use tree; examples: ~\cite{Jankun-Kelly2007}, VisTrails:~\cite{Bavoil2005}, or general graph if 'undo' action is explicited drawn
	\item overview of tree/graph visualizations?
	\item 'behavior graph' in Tableau
	\item encode time into graph: color coded~\cite{Bavoil2005}, edge length~\cite{Shrinivasan2008}
\end{itemize}
%\subsubsection{Tree Visualization}§
%\subsubsection{Hierarchical Graph Layout}
\paragraph{Visualization of Analytical Reasoning}
\begin{itemize}
	\item typically, use graph; examples: ~\cite{Shrinivasan2008}, Scalable Reasoning System, sandbox
	\item more formal visual arguments? that support toulmin, wigmore
\end{itemize}

I think set visualizations will be described in the related work of TimeSets and qualtitative research in SensePath
